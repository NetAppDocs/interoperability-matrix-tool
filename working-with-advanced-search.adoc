You can search for different components using *Advanced Search* and add or remove components from your search criteria. You can use the search text box within the *Advanced Search* window to search for components. You can use the following filters as needed:

* Select *Do not show Limited Support components* to prevent seeing components with limited
support in the results.
* Select *Do not show EOVS components* to prevent seeing components with end-of-version
support in the results.

From this page, you can also view the *Component Explorer, Load saved criteria or configurations*, or use the *Search Assistant*.
