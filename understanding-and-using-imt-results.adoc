Interoperability Matrix Tool allows you to view and export the results for the configurations that meet your requirements. From the *Results* page, you can build an end-to-end view by choosing a related solution which is compatible with the selected configuration. Additionally, you can use the *What If* feature to upgrade or downgrade a component within a configuration.
